        "Your entire source code is translated ahead of time into native machine code (binary) by a compiler—a standalone tool .\n",

        "Q3. What is the purpose of finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans 4.   Python’s logging is a built-in module designed to record important runtime information—like events, errors, warnings, and debug messages—so developers can better monitor, debug, and analyze their applications. Unlike simple print() statements, logging offers structured output, adjustable verbosity, and multiple output destinations.\n",
